# Dataset: 2019 Argentine General Election

The resulting dataset is availabel in `RDS` (for R), `xlsx` (for excel) and `csv` formats:

- `arg_elec_censo_wide.RDS`
- `arg_elec_censo_wide.csv`
- `arg_elec_censo_wide.xlsx`

This project aims to create a dataset combining census statistics and electoral results for the **Province of Buenos Aires** and the **City of BA**. These are the data sources combined:

- 2010 **census** statistics 
- 2019 **PASO** presidential election
- 2015 **PASO** presidential election
- 2015 **presidential** election

Data is aggregated at "circuito", the lowest level at which electoral results are available. In Argentina, census and electoral geography are independent so I had to create a lookup file for correspondences between census tracks and electoral "circuitos". I did this by computing the area intersected between both sets of boundaries.

## The dataset

The dataset contains relative estimates of some relevant census variables and electoral results. These are the variables (names are in Spanish):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble(Variable = c("id_circuito_elec",
                           "province",
                           "vi_*",
                           "ho_*",
                           "per_*",
                           "paso19_*",
                           "paso15_*",
                           "pres15_*"
                           ),
        Label = c("ID electoral circuit",
                    "Argentine province",
                    "Dwelling unit level variables",
                    "Household level variables",
                    "Person level variables",
                    "2019 PASO election variables",
                    "2015 PASO election variables",
                    "2015 Presidential election variables")
       ) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable()

```
