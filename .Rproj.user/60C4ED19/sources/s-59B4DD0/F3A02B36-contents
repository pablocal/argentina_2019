# Dataset: 2019 Argentinan elections

This project aims to create a dataset combining census statistics and electoral results. These are the data sources combined:

- 2010 **census** statistics
- 2019 **PASO** presidential elections
- 2015 **PASO** presidential elections
- 2015 **presidential** elections

Data is aggregated at "circuito", the lowest level at which electoral results are available. In Argentina, census and electoral geography are independent so I had to create a lookup file for correspondences between census tracks and electoral "circuitos". I did this by computing the area intersected between both set of boundaries.
